# BDD-project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ + ] This is the static version of the BDD mini-project that reads the username from a relational database (SQL).

[ + ] This is just the static version, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because GitHub Pages does not support server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, or Python ( For further information https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages )

[ + ] So, to simulate the dynamic page, we created multiple pages for detail and modification (for each user in the project), and we linked each page with its corresponding page, for example: detail_arn.html <=> modif_arn.html

[ + ] The index will test whether the input corresponds to a pseudo name. If yes, it will append it to the structured name link (if you notice, detail pages are in the form of 'detail_ '+ pseudo + '.html'), kind of like finding them dynamically

[ + ] The disadvantage is that you can't modify anything, and adding a person takes more time (due to the fact that you need to add a new whole page)

[ + ] So, why is this project you may ask? Well, it's to be able to test the layout on every device more easily and show how the layout changes from one device to another, and maybe to showcase it to the world and make it easily accessible even for us
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<<<<<<<<   Note  >>>>>>>>

+ The index.html corresponds to the formepage.php in the original project.

+ A list button was added to index to access the list.html (show all pseudo names, and be able to show their details by
  clicking on them (in the original project, you could access it from the WAMP server page
